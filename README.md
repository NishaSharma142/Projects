# Projects
In this repository we are going to add the projects of machine learning with python like titanic survival prediction, sales prediction, credit card fraud detection, Neural networks implementation to recognize handwritten numbers etc.

Python is very useful and powerful language for machine learning which is rich in in-built libraries and functions. In this repository we are going to implement machine learning algorithms to perform varuios tasks.

We are using the google colab platform to run the scripts.
